# Fluent

version 2.0

## Info

This is a theme carefully crafted & designed for modern computer screens, inspired by [Microsoft Fluent Design System](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/).

The theme now has a **built-in** dark mode support (Only tested on MacOS). Which means the theme changes with your system, and you don't have to manually setup any preferences.
